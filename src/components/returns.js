        We have extended our returns policy to 60 days as we realise it may be
        some time before customers are able to visit a post office to return an
        order. Should the situation continue for the foreseeable future we will
        extend this further.
      </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      If you receive your order and it is not what you are expecting you can
      return it back to us within <s>30</s> <strong>60 days</strong> for an
      exchange or refund. <br />
      <br /> UK customers can return their order for <strong>FREE</strong> with
      Royal Mail by following the instructions on our returns page.
      <br />
      <br />
      International customers will have to pay for the return postage and can
      find the full details for returning on our returns page. <br />
      <br />
      Both UK and International customers can return their order for an
      exchange, and once received we will swap over and send out the new item
      <strong> FREE</strong> of charge. <br />
